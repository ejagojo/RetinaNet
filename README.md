# RetinaNet

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based classification system to automate the detection of retinal diseases from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images. Retinal conditions like CNV, DME, and Drusen are among the leading causes of blindness globally. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly ResNet-50 with attention mechanisms, the model will classify OCT images from the OCT2017 dataset into four classes: CNV, DME, Drusen, and Normal. This solution targets enhancing diagnostic accessibility, accuracy, and scalability, especially in underserved regions.
